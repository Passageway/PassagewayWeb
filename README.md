## Polymer Starter Kit

> A starting point for building web applications with Polymer 1.0

### Included out of the box:

* [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org), [Paper](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements), [Iron](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=iron-elements) and [Neon](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=neon-elements) elements
* [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) layout
* Routing with [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/)
* Unit testing with [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
* Optional offline setup through [Platinum](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=platinum-elements) Service Worker elements
* End-to-end Build Tooling (including [Vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize))

## Getting Started

To take advantage of Polymer Starter Kit you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Modify the application to your liking.
4. Deploy your production code.

### Get the code

[Download](https://github.com/polymerelements/polymer-starter-kit/releases/latest) and extract Polymer Starter Kit to where you want to work. The project comes in two flavours - Lite and Full.

**Beginners**: Try Polymer Starter Kit Lite. This doesn't require any extra dependencies nor knowledge of modern front-end tooling. This option is good for prototyping if you haven't build a Polymer app before.

**Intermediate - Advanced**: Use the full version of Polymer Starter Kit. This comes with all the build tools you'll need for testing and productionising your app so it's nice and lean. You'll need to run a few extra commands to install the tools we recommend but it's worth it to make sure your final app is super optimised.

Rob Dodson has a fantastic [PolyCast video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz-yixRxZN8) available that walks through using Polymer Starter Kit.

### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above v6.6.0. 

__Ubuntu__  
Otherwise run:
```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

__Windows__  
Use the [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#download)

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd polymer-starter-kit && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### Bower dependencies 

To update Bower dependencies:  
```sh
bower install paper-time-picker
```

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

## Application Theming & Styling

Polymer 1.0 introduces a shim for CSS custom properties. We take advantage of this in `app/styles/app-theme.html` to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.

[Read more](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html) about CSS custom properties.

### Styling
1. ***main.css*** - to define styles that can be applied outside of Polymer's custom CSS properties implementation. Some of the use-cases include defining styles that you want to be applied for a splash screen, styles for your application 'shell' before it gets upgraded using Polymer or critical style blocks that you want parsed before your elements are.
2. ***app-theme.html*** - to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.
3. ***shared-styles.html*** - to shared styles between elements and index.html.
4. ***element styles only*** - styles specific to element. These styles should be inside the `<style></style>` inside `template`.

  ```HTML
  <dom-module id="my-list">
    <template>
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          background-color: yellow;
        }
      </style>
      <ul>
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{items}}">
          <li><span class="paper-font-body1">{{item}}</span></li>
        </template>
      </ul>
    </template>
  </dom-module>
  ```

These style files are located in the [styles folder](app/styles/).

## Unit Testing

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

## Dependency Management

Polymer uses [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies.

## Service Worker

Polymer Starter Kit offers an optional offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the [Platinum Service Worker elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw). New to Service Worker? Read the following [introduction](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/) to understand how it works.

Our optional offline setup should work well for relatively simple applications. For more complex apps, we recommend learning how Service Worker works so that you can make the most of the Platinum Service Worker element abstractions.


### How do I add new JavaScript files to Starter Kit so they're picked up by the build process?

At the bottom of `app/index.html`, you will find a build block that can be used to include additional
scripts for your app. Build blocks are just normal script tags that are wrapped in a HTML
comment that indicates where to concatenate and minify their final contents to.

Below, we've added in `script2.js` and `script3.js` to this block. The line
`<!-- build:js scripts/app.js -->` specifies that these scripts will be squashed into `scripts/app.js`
during a build.

```html
<!-- build:js scripts/app.js -->
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/script2.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/script3.js"></script>
<!-- endbuild-->
```

If you are not using the build-blocks, but still wish for additional files (e.g scripts or stylesheets) to be included in the final `dist` directory, you will need to either copy these files as part of the gulpfile.js build process (see the `copy` task for how to automate this) or manually copy the files.
